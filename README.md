# Esker Programming Assignment
* How to run:
  * This script uses Python 3.7
  * To run the script enter `python3 esker_file_reader.py sample.txt` into your terminal/command line, where "sample.txt" is the name of the file to be read
    * The file must be in the same directory as the script in order to be read by the script
* Assumptions made:
  * File type is a .txt file
  * All words are spelled correctly
  * Numbers do not count as words (ex: dates, integers, fractions ...)
  * Numbers can be within a word for that string to be considered a word (ex: P2P or O2C)
* Amount of time spent completing the code: 1hr 45min
